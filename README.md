# Titanic_survived_prediction
This project predicts Titanic survival using the Naive Bayes algorithm. It processes data by mapping gender to numerical values, handling missing age data, and splitting it into training and test sets. The model is trained and tested for accuracy. Users can input passenger details (age, sex, fare, class) to predict survival.
